			<p style="text-align: center;">This Challenge is a tool that facilitates inviting potential leads into experiencing our products, healthy active lifestyle and community to help them stay on track, get better results and eventually expose them to the business opportunity.</p>
			</div>
		<div> <p style="text-align: center;">If used correctly this is a great tool for retailing, retention and recruiting as it is meant to help you transition retail clients into preferred members and eventually distributors. We highly encourage that as a coach you follow the 21 day plan as if you were a challenger, do the workouts and document your progress on social media so that this becomes an easy tool for you to use and attract more prospects.</p>
			</div>
		<div>Challenges run for 21 days starting always on the first Monday of every month, making it an easy to follow schedule for both coaches and challengers. There is a prize pot of $10,000 that gets paid out to 10 winners equally in $1,000 single prizes, after voting is concluded. </div>
